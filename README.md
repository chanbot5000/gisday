Automating Map Production with Google Earth and Python
======

See parcel_script.py for geoprocessing code.

##How to:
i) Create directory /gisday/out to store files created by Python script (git ignores empty directories so that is why it is not shown in the repo)

1) Allow Google Earth access to local files by clicking the Tools Menu > Options > General tab > Allow access to local files and personal data

2) Create point in Google Earth. Add hyperlink to parcel_script.py by clicking Add link... and choosing parcel_script.py

3) Draw polygon in Google Earth and save it as /src/poly.kml

4) Click hyperlink to point in the info window

5) Choose title for map and output directory

6) Run script
